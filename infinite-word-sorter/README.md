## Infinite Word Sorter

**Description:**
- From Chris Pine's Learn To Program - [Chapter 7: Arrays and Iterators](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/chap_07.html).
- Get as many words from the user until `<ENTER>` is pressed on an empty line.
- Sort the words, without the built in `<sort>` method and print it.

- From The Odin Project's [Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/fundamentals-part-5).
- Receive a string in any case and return it in `snake_case`.
- Use regular expressions.
- Work with lowercase, caps, punctuation, `camelCase`, `kebab-case` and `WtF..CaSe`.
